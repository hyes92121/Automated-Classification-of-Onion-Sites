What is Bitcoin:
Bitcoin is an anonymous peer-to-peer cryptocurrency invented by someone who gave himself the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto in 2009.
It now has millions of users and all bitcoins together are worth over a billion US dollar.
All you need to use Bitcoins as a payment method on the internet is a Bitcoin Wallet like EasyCoin and some website or person to buy Bitcoins from.
But bitcoin is only truly anonymous and untraceable if you are really careful not disclosing your identity.
Easycoin is trying to help with that and protects its users privacy by default instead of having the user take care of it like all other bitcoin wallets.
An observer wont be able to track you on the bitcoin blockchain when you use EasyCoin bitcoin wallet.

Create an account on EasyCoin, make sure you write down your username and password and optionally your transaction PIN at a secure place.
Then go to the Buy Bitcoins page for a small list of websites selling bitcoins, there are dozens more, just google for "Buy Bitcoins".
If you want to buy or sell bitcoins in a really anonymous way without using banks etc, check out localbitcoins.com for person to person bitcoin exchange.
